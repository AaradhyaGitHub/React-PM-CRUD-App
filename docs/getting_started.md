# Getting Started: 01 - Initial Setup

This guide walks through the initial steps of setting up the project. The local repository is downloaded, dependencies are installed, and the server is set up. Git is initialized for version control, and a documentation folder is created.

## 1. Local Repository Downloaded

The project was downloaded from the starting point and extracted to a local directory. 

## 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required npm packages:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev

```
## 3. Open local development server 

It should look somthing like:
```sh 
Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```
